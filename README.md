# Trajectory Prediction Project
## Overview
This project focuses on trajectory prediction using various models. It leverages the KITTI dataset for training and evaluation and provides tools for visualizing the predicted trajectories.

The codes are based on codes of the trajecotroy prediction shared by https://github.com/fedebecat and is modified to address our desired goals.

# Setup
## Create a Virtual Environment
To ensure the correct dependencies are installed, it's recommended to create a virtual environment. Run the following commands:<br>
`python -m venv env`<br>
`source env/bin/activate`   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`<br>
## Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
## Dataset 
### Download KITTI Dataset
First, download the KITTI Raw dataset and split it into the appropriate format. Place the dataset in the kitti_raw_data folder.
## Training and Evaluation
To train and evaluate your model, run the train.py script. You can choose between different models by setting the appropriate model in the script:<br>
- model_multiLayer<br>
- model_singleLayer<br>
- Or your custom model<be>

### Run the script using:
`python train.py`
## Plotting Trajectories
To visualize the predicted trajectories, run the plot_trajectory.py script:<br>
`python plot_trajectory.py`<br>
## Pre-trained Models
You can download pre-trained models from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1lqrbjgdvg6ehVujU3rSiHxDdaPz701mR) <br>
# Repository Structure
`train.py`: Script to train and evaluate the model.<br>
`plot_trajectory.py`: Script to plot the predicted trajectories.<br>
kitti_raw_data: Folder where the KITTI dataset should be placed.<br>
